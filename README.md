# sorting-exercise
An exercise in sorting a hierarchical list of data.

## Setup
To install required dev dependencies to run and build the application, run `npm install`.

## Run
To run the application (no build required), run `npm start`.

To change the input array, modify the `products` array in the file `src/constants/input.constants.ts`.

## Debug
To debug the application in VS Code, simply run the debugger.

## Build
To build the source into transpiled javascript, run `npm build`. The output will be in the `dist` directory.

You can then import the `processHierarchy` function from the `dist/src/functions/process-hierarchy.function` module.
